## Vision

**What is the vision of this product?**

Our vision is to upgrade the Code Fellows educational experience by harnessing the power of AI and connecting it with student needs. By developing a Slack bot integrated with OpenAI, we aim to provide seamless assistance to students struggling with lab work, enabling them to receive real-time guidance and support in their coding endeavors. Our product seeks to bridge the gap between academia and technology, empowering students to excel in their coursework and foster a deeper understanding of complex problems presented throughout their journey at Code Fellows.

**What pain point does this project solve?**

The pain point we are aiming to solve is students struggling with lab work. We recognize that students often encounter difficulties while conducting their labs on a daily basis at times. By providing a Slack bot connected to OpenAI, the product offers a solution to this problem by offering real-time help and guidance to students, effectively supporting them in overcoming challenges and enhancing their understanding and performance in the labs.

## Why should we care about your product?

**IN -** 

    1. Our chat bot will allow students to paste in their entire lab and be able to receive a checklist of things to accomplish.
    2. Our chat bot will be able to have commands that users can do to pull up a faq with pre generated answers to questions about the bot.
    3. Students will be able to have access to the bot from anywhere in the workspace.
    4. Students will be able to ask other in depth questions about their lab by simply calling on the bot and asking questions directly in the message.

**OUT -** 

    1. This will never be turned into a phone app.
    2. This will never be a replacement to actually completing your own lab work.
    3. This will never be more than a tool for developers to lean on when hitting walls within their labs/assignments.
  
## Minimum Viable Product vs

Our MVP will be a working chat bot within a Slack workspace that allows for users to copy paste in their lab instructions and get feedback from the Open AI API for assistance.

Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

    An admin can create and delete user accounts
    A user can update their profile information
    A user can search all of the products in the inventory

## Data Flow

Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.
Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)

## Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)

Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

    Security
    Usability
    Testability
    etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
